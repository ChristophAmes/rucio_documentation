## API Documentation

Should there be any changes to the APIs listed
[__here__](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/tree/master/lib/rucio/web/rest/flaskapi/v1)
& [__here__](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/tree/master/lib/rucio/client), an
entire rebuild of the Markdown files needs to be carried out to reflect the new
content. This will be triggered automatically via Github Actions once your pull
request for modification to the **main** branch is approved.

## Markdown Documentation

All the other documentation on this website is built using
[__Docusaurus__](https://docusaurus.io/) and is written in Markdown. It lives in
the `docs` folder on the **main** branch of the
[`rucio/documentation`](https://github.com/rucio/documentation) GitHub
repository.
