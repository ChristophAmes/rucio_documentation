Rucio is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing
scientific collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across
facilities at multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed
by [the ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/)

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. It is a data
management solution that could cover the needs of different communities in the
scientific domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).

Below are some resources to help you get you started on your journey.

## [Before You Get Started](before_you_get_started.md)

What exactly is Rucio? What were the motivations behind developing such a
system? Who uses it? What powers these systems? Answers to all these questions
and more can be found by browsing through the sub-sections of this topic.

## Try Rucio

Get your hands dirty by trying to setup your very own demo environment on your
local laptop/desktop. Make sure you read the pre-requisites section before
starting off, though!

- [Setting up Demo environment](setting_up_demo)
- [Rucio executables](bin.md)

## Rucio User Playground

Congratulations on setting up your Rucio environment! Let us now have a look at
some of the common things you can do using Rucio by setting up the Rucio
client. Also, this section will introduce you to some common CLI commands that
you, as a user, might find helpful when working with Rucio.

## Rucio Operator Documentation

This section of the documentation deals with some of the material that an
operator or administrator of a Rucio environment would require. For example, how
to install a server or some quick tips for working with the administrative
CLI. Take a deep dive, but not before you ensure you've read through the
pre-requisites section under each of the topics!

- [Installing Rucio Daemons](installing_daemons.md)
- [Monitoring](monitoring.md)
- [Configuration parameters](configuration_parameters.md)

## Rucio Developer Documentation

Whether you want to develop with Rucio or contribute to the project, the
Developer documentation will help you get started. Peruse some common REST API &
Client API references that are directly derived from Rucio's python
libraries. We also have a contribution guide for those who wish to pitch in.

  Tool](configure-rucio-globus)
- [Contributing guide](contributing)

## Contributing to the Documentation

Documentation is always a work in progress & we welcome both, qualitative and
technical contributions from the community. Make sure you look into the
[documentations GitHub repository](https://github.com/rucio/documentation) &
understand the pre-requisites before you submit your first PR!
